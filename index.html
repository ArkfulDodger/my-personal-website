            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello and welcome!</p>
            <p>I am a game engineer with a background in theatre and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://soundcloud.com/noahreece/sets/soundtrackdemos">musical composition</a>. I've always loved building worlds in various mediums, and video game development lives right at the nexus of my technical and artistic passions. During the 2020 lockdown, I dedicated myself to developing the programming skills I needed to bring my ideas to life, not just as a hobby, but as a career!</p>
            <p>I draw a lot of inspiration from my favorite games, from industry classics like Ocarina of Time, with its masterful integration of music, story, and fun, to relatively newer releases such as Hades, whose beautifully dynamic dialogue system helps instill a constant sense of progression to its cyclical gameplay.</p></div>
